Visualising customer and agent behaviour

The digital revolution and our fast-changing world requires a skills revolution. And it’s not just about the digital skills. The skills revolution is about helping people build their digital awareness, emotional intelligence and creativity to fully participate in the digital future workplace — and it needs to start now.

At PwC, we are working with other organisations across the world, building on our work with clients and on upskilling our 276,000 people. Still, more must be done if we are to ensure everyone has the opportunity to learn, work and participate in the digital world. This is at the heart of our purpose.

We are enabling employees who are motivated to further accelerate their skills to do so by offering them a “career pivot” to become what we call “Digital Accelerators”. Accelerators rapidly deepen their skills in digital specialties, such as data, automation, AI, and digital storytelling by learning a variety of self-service tools and coding languages and applying these skills across our business.

Call Center Analysis Dashboard:
A Call Center Analysis dashboard typically tracks the performance of a company's call center. Here’s a breakdown of the key metrics and visualizations that could be included:

1.Call Volume by Time Period:

- Visualization: Bar or Line Chart
- Description: This could show the number of calls received on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. It helps identify patterns in call volumes, such as peak hours or days when more calls are received.
2. Average Handling Time (AHT):

- Visualization: Gauge or KPI
- Description: A key metric that shows the average time a call takes from start to finish, including after-call work. This helps assess the efficiency of call center agents.
3. Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT):

- Visualization: Bar Chart or KPI
- Description: Customer feedback after a call, often on a scale of 1 to 5. This metric measures how satisfied customers are with the service they received.
4. Agent Performance:

- Visualization: Table or Bar Chart
- Description: This provides an overview of individual agents' performance, including metrics such as calls handled, average handling time, and customer satisfaction.
5. Call Drop Rate:

- Visualization: Line Chart or KPI
- Description: The percentage of calls that were dropped before being handled by an agent. This metric is critical for monitoring technical issues or inefficiencies.
6. First Call Resolution (FCR):

- Visualization: Bar Chart or KPI
- Description: The percentage of calls resolved on the first contact. Higher FCR rates are indicative of efficient problem resolution and customer satisfaction.
7. Call Types:

- Visualization: Pie Chart
- Description: A breakdown of the different types of calls (e.g., inquiries, complaints, support, etc.) to help identify common reasons customers contact the call center.
